# AppDevelopment
All the files are withing pythonProject folder.

List of files:

age.py - Calculates user's age by asking them their year of birth and taking it out of the current year (2024). Was made to practice user inputs in python. FUNCTIONS USED: input(),print()

args.py - made to practice passing variable ammount of arguments within a function. The code takes a variable number of marks and calculates their average before telling if a student passed or failed depending on if the average is above or bellow 50. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), try, except, for in, if else, print(), args, list

arithmetics.py - made to practice classes within python. The code is a simple arithmetics calculator that can add, subtract and calculate Pythagoras's theorem with two numbers. Also used to to practice extractin root of a number without importing math module. FUNCTIONS USED: class, print(), if else

array sum.py - practice of inputting several numbers into a function before I learned about *args. The code asks you how many numbers you want to input and then has you input however many numbers you specified before summing them all up. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), for in range, for in, input(), list

arrayslicing.py - practice of slicing an array. Prints an array a number of times sliced in different ways. FUNCTIONS USED: print(), slicing, list

cars4.py - loop practice. Prints names of three cars with different colors added to them. FUNCTIONS USED: for in, print, list

class_cars.py - practice of classes. Prints name of a car and its maliage multiplied by ten. FUNCTIONS USED: class, print()

classes_test.py - the very first code with classes. Prints "Apple is red". "Apple" and "red" can be replaced with any other fruit and color respectively. FUNCTIONS USED: class, print()

codeprint.py - practicing IF function and slicing. The code asks for a student ID, name, lastname and to write that they are newbie in Whitecliffe. If they do, they will recieve a code that is first two symbols of their ID and first three symbols of their lastname. FUNCTIONS USED: if elif else, print(), input(), slicing.

defgrades.py - earlier itteration of args.py before i've learned *args function. Works largely the same as array sum.py, plus function to print if a student passed or failed. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), if else, for in, list, print(), input(), type manipulation

englandismycity.py - practice of manipulating array. Asks to input five cities that get added to an array, then prints the array's length, prints the array, deletes the first entry, then adds Hong to the list and then reverses the list. FUNCTIONS USED: while, print(), list, list manipulation

fruit price names.py - practice of **kwargs function. prints names of all the fruits and then a list of keys. FUNCTIONS USED: kwargs, def function(), for in, print()

fruit_price.py - same as fruit price names.py, but prints sum of prices of all the fruits. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), for in, kwargs, print()

ifscore.py - practice of if function and one of the earlier score calculating programs. Only takes in four marks and assigns overal marks from A to Fail depending on the average. FUNCTIONS USED: while, input(), if elif else, type manipulation

lotsanumbers.py - prints numbers from 0 to 100, with steps of 5. Practice of range function. FUNCTIONS USED: for in range, print()

marks2themarkening.py - practice of the *args function. Same as args.py, but isntead of just pass or fail, assigns classes from first to second lower classes depending on how high is the average score. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), for in, print(), if elif, args

nameagestuff.py - practice with arrays. Asks the user to input name and age up until there are 7 pairs, then prints said pairs and prints all the ages bellow 20. FUNCTIONS USED: list, while, input(), print(), for in, if

random_number.py - practice of random numbers. Prints numbers from 1 to 20 in random order. FUNCTIONS USED: import, print, random.sample

root.py - practice of arithmetics functions. Extracts root of (x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2, with all the x and y being inputs by the user. FUNCTIONS USED: import, input(), math.sqrt(), type manipulation

score_arvg_kwargs.py - practice of using kwargs function to calculate scores. The current version was used to practice except TypeError function. To make it work as intended, replace "k" with a number. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), kwargs, try, for in, except, print()

scorepassorfail.py - earliest score calculation code. Takes in four values from user, calculates average and says if it's pass or fail. FUNCTIONS USED: input(), if else, type manipulation

shopping_calculator.py - part of practice for inporting functions from other files. purchase_total function calcualates total price of all bought goods, and discount applies a discount if the first letter is a vowel. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), for in, if, dictionaries, kwargs

student_dict.py - practice of dictionaries. Asks how many students there are, then asks you to input a number of a student and their name before adding it to the array, then prints the dictionary. FUNCTIONS USED: dictionaries, def function(), for in, input(), type manipulation

subandadd.py - one of the earlier codes made to practice functions. Calculates a sum and subtraction of two numbers, then prints them. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), input(), print(), type manipulation

test.py - practicing importing functions from shopping_calculator.py. Unfortunatelly, it doesn't work at the moment due to me trying to improve the code, resulting into it an error regarding positional arguments.  FUNCTIONS USED: import function, print(), kwargs, dictionary

variable types.py - practice of manipulating types of variables, includiong printing, changing and calling types. FUNCTIONS USED: print, type manipulation

vowels.py - practice of loops. Counts how many vowels there are in a message input by a user. FUNCTIONS USED: for in, if, list

what.py - same as subandadd, but instead of subtracting, it divides. FUNCTIONS USED: def function(), print()
