All the files are withing pythonProject folder.
List of files:
age.py - Calculates user's age by asking them their year of birth and taking it out of the current year (2024). Was made to practice user inputs in python.
args.py - made to practice passing variable ammount of arguments within a function. The code takes a variable number of marks and calculates their average before telling if a student passed or failed depending on if the average is above or bellow 50
arithmetics.py - made to practice classes within python. The code is a simple arithmetics calculator that can add, subtract and calculate Pythagoras's theorem with two numbers 
array sum.py - practice of inputting several numbers into a function before I learned about *args. The code asks you how many numbers you want to input and then has you input however many numbers you specified before summing them all up.
arrayslicing.py - practice of slicing an array. Prints an array a number of times sliced in different ways.
cars4.py - loop practice. Prints names of three cars with different colors added to them.
class_cars.py - practice of classes. Prints name of a car and its maliage multiplied by ten.
classes_test.py - the very first code with classes. Prints "Apple is red". "Apple" and "red" can be replaced with any other fruit and color respectively.
codeprint.py - practicing IF function and slicing. The code asks for a student ID, name, lastname and to write that they are newbie in Whitecliffe. If they do, they will recieve a code that is first two symbols of their ID and first three symbols of their lastname.
defgrades.py - earlier itteration of args.py before i've learned *args function. Works largely the same as array sum.py, plus function to print if a student passed or failed.
englandismycity.py - practice of manipulating array. Asks to input five cities that get added to an array, then prints the array's length, prints the array, deletes the first entry, then adds Hong to the list and then reverses the list.
fruit price names.py - practice of **kwargs function. prints names of all the fruits and then a list of keys.
fruit_price.py - same as fruit price names.py, but prints sum of prices of all the fruits.
ifscore.py - practice of if function and one of the earlier score calculating programs. Only takes in four marks and assigns overal marks from A to Fail depending on the average.
lotsanumbers.py - prints numbers from 0 to 100, with steps of 5. Practice of range function.
marks2themarkening.py - practice of the *args function. Same as args.py, but isntead of just pass or fail, assigns classes from first to second lower classes depending on how high is the average score.
nameagestuff.py - practice with arrays. Asks the user to input name and age up until there are 7 pairs, then prints said pairs and prints all the ages bellow 20.
random_number.py - practice of random numbers. Prints numbers from 1 to 20 in random order.
root.py - practice of arithmetics functions. Calculates root of (x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2, with all the x and y being inputs by the user.
score_arvg_kwargs.py - practice of using kwargs function to calculate scores. The current version was used to practice except TypeError function. To make it work as intended, replace "k" with a number.
scorepassorfail.py - earliest score calculation code. Takes in four values from user, calculates average and says if it's pass or fail.
shopping_calculator.py - part of practice for inporting functions from other files. purchase_total function calcualates total price of all bought goods, and discount applies a discount if the first letter is a vowel.
student_dict.py - practice of dictionaries. Asks how many students there are, then asks you to input a number of a student and their name before adding it to the array, then prints the dictionary.
subandadd.py - one of the earlier codes made to practice functions. Calculates a sum and subtraction of two numbers, then prints them.
test.py - practicing importing functions from shopping_calculator.py
variable types.py - practice of manipulating types of variables, includiong printing, changing and calling types.
vowels.py - practice of loops. Counts how many vowels there are in a message input by a user.
what.py - same as subandadd, but instead of subtracting, it divides.
